# Module 2: Digital Twins & Simulation

Bridge the physical and digital worlds through realistic robot simulation.

This module teaches you how to create digital twins of robotic systems, enabling safe testing, validation, and development before deploying to real hardware.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating accurate digital twins using URDF modeling
- Setting up realistic physics simulation environments
- Integrating sensors and validating their behavior
- Building complete simulation pipelines for robot development

## Module Chapters

1. **[URDF Modeling](./chapter-01-urdf-modeling.md)** - Learn to define robot geometry, joints, and properties
2. **[Physics & Gazebo Setup](./chapter-02-physics-gazebo-setup.md)** - Configure realistic physics simulation
3. **[Unity Rendering & Interaction](./chapter-03-unity-rendering-interaction.md)** - Visualize and interact with your robot
4. **[Sensor Simulation & Validation](./chapter-04-sensor-simulation-validation.md)** - Simulate and validate sensor data

## Why Digital Twins Matter

Digital twins allow you to:
- Test dangerous scenarios safely
- Iterate faster without hardware wear
- Validate algorithms before deployment
- Train AI models with synthetic data

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: URDF Modeling](./chapter-01-urdf-modeling.md) to create your first robot digital twin. -->
