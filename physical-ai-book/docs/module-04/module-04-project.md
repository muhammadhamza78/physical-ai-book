# Module 4 Project – Intelligent Physical AI System

## Overview

In this project, you will integrate **perception, planning, control, and deployment** into a single intelligent physical AI system.  
The goal is to demonstrate an **end-to-end working pipeline** that runs without runtime or build errors in Docusaurus.

This project validates that all concepts from Module 4 are implemented correctly.

---

## Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Build a complete Physical AI pipeline
- Integrate perception and planning modules
- Ensure system runs without MDX or runtime errors
- Successfully render documentation using `npm start`

---

## Project Requirements

Your system must include:

- ✅ Working perception pipeline (camera / sensor based)
- ✅ Decision-making or planning logic
- ✅ Control output (navigation / motion / action)
- ✅ Clean documentation build (no MDX errors)

---

## Deliverables

Submit the following:

- Project documentation (`.md` files)
- Architecture explanation
- Screenshots or logs (optional)
- Clean `npm start` build

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated using the following scale:

- **A (`>=90`)**: Fully functional system with all tasks completed
- **B (`>=75`)**: Minor issues, most tasks completed
- **C (`>=60`)**: Some tasks missing or incomplete
- **F (`<60`)**: Major components missing or non-functional

> ⚠️ Note: Backticks are intentionally used to avoid MDX parsing errors.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using `<` or `>` without backticks
- Leaving `_category_.json` empty
- Missing frontmatter (`---`)
- Incorrect sidebar positions
- Unclosed MDX tags like `<details>`

---

## Final Checklist

Before submission, verify:

- [ ] `npm start` runs without errors
- [ ] Module 4 appears in sidebar
- [ ] All `.md` files have valid frontmatter
- [ ] No raw `< >` symbols in text
- [ ] `_category_.json` is properly filled
